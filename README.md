# 2.8-Touch
This project demonstrates the use of a 2.8" SPI TFT 240x320 Touch Display module with an Arduino Uno.
The display is 3.3V only therefore output signals from the Uno are stepped down using a simple 1k/1k
voltage divider.
ON and OFF buttons are drawn to the display. When a touch is detected withing a button's perimeter
a LED is switched appropriately.
